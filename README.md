# Global Classroom: Indiana University and Higher School of Economics

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Indiana University and Higher School of Economics

about the projects you can participate in. 

## Projects

1. [Tone prediction and orthographic conversion for Basaa](basaa/)
2. [Predictive text for Chukchi](chukchi/)

## Baselines

Each project has a simple baseline system written to demonstrate how to process and evaluate
the data. The baselines are designed so as to not use any external libraries to make them easy
to run and get started with.
